# "Maybe" Monad

Package can be built using both **Stack** and **Cabal** on **Windows 11**.

Contains initial `Barans.hs` (aka `Sheeps.hs`) and my `Sheeps.Functions` module.

## How to build and run:
1. Download and unpack one of release archives.
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell (via <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, write `wt`, <kbd>Enter</kbd>).
3. Go to unpacked archive (`cd` for Command Prompt, `Set-Location` for PowerShell).
4. Build the project:
    1. For Stack:
    ```
    stack build
    ```
    1. For Cabal:
    ```
    cabal build
    ```
5. That's all!
