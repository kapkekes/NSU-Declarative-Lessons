## How to build and run:
1. Download and unpack one of release archives.
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell (via <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, write `wt`, <kbd>Enter</kbd>).
3. Go to unpacked archive (`cd` for Command Prompt, `Set-Location` for PowerShell).
4. Run project:
    1. For Stack:
    ```
    stack run

    2. For Cabal:
    ```
    cabal run
    ```
5. Check magically appeared `output` folder.
6. That's all!
